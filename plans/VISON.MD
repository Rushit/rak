## Vision

Make agent development and deployment simpler for developers. 

## User Problem

as a vibe coder, i can develop UI and product quickly but i need better way to test my agent and ability to deploy them to be accessible to my users.

Vibe-coder can create multiple agents and deploy,
autonomous or HIL in their app.

## Features
testable url (/admin), 
observability as developer what's happening in my agent (langfuse capabilities), 
ability to build user interface for users, 
eg SDK for my vibe coding platform which allow me to directly use deployed agents. 
Integration hooks back to my application for in-product discovery etc,
multitanacy support
Ability to access their datastores for agent works (MCP)
Ability to run agent daily eg suggestion about your campaign
Ability to run agent on-go event base, user enter something and agent need to perform
Ability to chat with agent based on information it has.
